# Breast CycleGAN reproduction

This repository contains the reproduction of the first experiment of **Injecting and removing malignant features in mammography with CycleGAN: Investigation of an automated adversarial attack using neural networks**, Anton S. Becker, Lukas Jendele, Ondrej Skopek, Nicole Berger, Soleen Ghafoor, Magda Marcon, Ender Konukoglu. [1].

## The code

We used the official implementation [2] for our experiment. We want to stress that the code used for the CycleGANs have been adapted from it.
