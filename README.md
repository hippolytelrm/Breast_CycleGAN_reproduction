# Breast CycleGAN reproduction

This repository contains the reproduction of the first experiment of **Injecting and removing malignant features in mammography with CycleGAN: Investigation of an automated adversarial attack using neural networks**, Anton S. Becker, Lukas Jendele, Ondrej Skopek, Nicole Berger, Soleen Ghafoor, Magda Marcon, Ender Konukoglu. [1] on the InBreast dataset.
For the InBreast dataset, please refer to: http://medicalresearch.inescporto.pt/breastresearch/index.php/Get_INbreast_Database [2]


## The code

We used the official implementation [3] for our experiment. We want to stress that the code we used for the CycleGANs have been adapted from the original experiment by Becker et al., 2018.
